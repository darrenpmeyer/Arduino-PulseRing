# Arduino-PulseRing
A "shimmery" pulse for NeoPixel rings using [FastLED3.1](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/FastLED3.1).

This is a useful demo/learning sketch which provides in-code documentation as well as easy-to-configure options
for how the animation runs. The code is simple, and the logic is easy to follow.
